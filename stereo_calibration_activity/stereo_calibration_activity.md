# Stereo Calibrator Activity

Short activity for identifying the extrinsic parameters of a camera pair.

Although we are using the stereo camera calibrator app for this activity, 
the principles are the same for any multi camera calibration with a shared field of view.

In this scenario we have a pair of cameras mounted on a vehicle in an indoor environment.
This is a limited amount of visual and physical clutter in the scene.

## Opening Matlab

Depending on the provision you will either be using MATLAB installed on the provided laptops or MATLAB Online.

Both tools function near identically once open but running the software is different.

## Loading the images

You should be looking at the MATLAB Stereo Camera Calibrator screen.

## Detection Results

You should be looking at the `Detection Results` window.

- This window should should have details of the `Total stereo pairs processed` and `Rejected stereo pairs`.

{{1}}
> **Click `view images` to see the rejected images.**
>

**What do you notice about the rejected images?**

- Why did MATLAB not include them in the calibration process?

<details>
<summary>**Hint 1**</summary>

*The rejected images all have the same issue*.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Hint 2**</summary>

*The rejected pairs have the calibration target missing from one of the pair.*

*At least part of the target is missing.*

*In some cases the entire target is absent.*

</details>
  







{{2}}
> **Click `OK` to close the `Rejected Images` window.**

{{3}}

## Calibration

You should now be on the calibration screen with the images loaded.

![](images/calibration_window.png)

**See that the images for the stereo pairs are different.**

- This is because the cameras are in different positions.

**See that the checkerboard pattern has been detected in each image.**

- Corner points of the inner checkerboard squares are marked with circles.
- Checkerboard pattern is a known size, so the distance between the circles is known.
  - Apparent distance between the circles (in pixels) *something something distance*
- Checkerboard pattern is a rectangle, not a square.
  - To avoid possible confusion regarding the orientation of the target.

## Results

{{1}}

{{2}}
> Double click on `PoseCamera2`.

`PoseCamera2` is a structure containing multiple pieces of information.

- `Translation` is the $[X, Y, Z]$ positions.
  - In millimeters.
- `R` is the 3x3 rotation matrix.
  - In radians.
- `A` is the 4x4 transformation matrix.
  - I.e. the combination of `R` and `Translation`.

## Answers

The image pairs were taken from pair of cameras mounted on a simulated Range Rover.

For this scenario the cameras were deliberately miss-aligned in order to create a issue for sensor fusion.

Because this is a simulated environment rather than reality we can easily extract actual positions and orientations of the cameras to compare against the results of the calibration.

It is extremely unlikely that the calibration values that you have obtained will match these exactly.

- Especially with the limited number of images used.
- There are additional steps that could be taken to improve the calibration.

  - But they add time and complexity.

The important thing is that the values are within the right ballpark.

- If the values are wildly different then could be an issue with the calibration process.
- Or it could indicate that the cameras are not correctly aligned.

## End of Activity

Well done, with any luck you know have a better understanding of how to calibrate a pair of cameras.

Other sensors calibrations depend on the same principles but the specifics will vary according to the sensor type.

Calibrating lidar for example relies on identifying the physical shape of the calibration target in the point cloud data as opposed to the pattern on the target.
